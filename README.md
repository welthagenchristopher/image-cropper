Nothing special here - took me about 5 minutes to write, which shows. I only needed the extensive whitespace removed from a few hundred images, so it crops in a regular quadrilateral shape.

Easy to modify if you'd like to eliminate all whitespace, regardless of angles - though this method won't work for vector format.
